// HTTP2 Decoder Library
//
// This library provides a limited decoder for parsing HTTP2 TCP protocol stream.
//
// At this time, the TCP HTTP2 data streams which are fed into the decoder generate only three callbacks -
//  1. When the header frame has arrived
//  2. Each HTTP2 request/response header
//  3. Decoding error.
//
// This library provides two classes:
//
//   qd_http2_decoder_connection_t - a connection state for a single TCP connection over which
//   HTTP2 streams are exchanged between a client and a server.
//
//   qd_http2_decoder_t - the decoder (can represent a client or server side decoder).
//   This decoder ignores all frames except the request/response frames. It deep processes the
//   request/response headers frame to get request and response headers. CONTINUATION frames are ignored.
//
//   The decoder does not validate the HTTP2 stream.
//
